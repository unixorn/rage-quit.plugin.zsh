# rage-quit plugin for antigen

based on [rage-quit plugin for oh-my-zsh](https://gist.github.com/sztupy/9138124) which in turn
was based on [rage-quit support for bash](https://gist.github.com/namuol/9122237)

# HOW TO INSTALL
Add ```antigen bundle unixorn/rake-completion.zshplugin``` to your zshrc.

This plugin adds itself to your $PATH so you don't have to install
flip separately.

I didn't write any of this, I just bundled it for antigen.
